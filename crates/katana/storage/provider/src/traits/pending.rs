/// A provider for pending block data ie., header, transactions, receipts, traces (if any).
// In the context of a full node, where the node doesn't produce the blocks itself, how it can
// provide the pending block data could be from a remote sequencer or feeder gateway. But, if the
// node itself is a sequencer, it can provide the pending block data from its own local state. So,
// the main motivation for this trait is to provide a common interface for both cases.
//
// TODO: Maybe more to rpc crate as this is mainly gonna be used in the rpc side.
